The first part of this exercise is to look at customer that accept coupons to a bar. The questions are part of a prompt. 

Overall there was a 41% coupon acceptance rate for the Bar. 
There is a correlation between acceptance rate and how many times the driver goes to the bar. The more often they go to the bar, the more likely they are to accept the coupon. 
Other factors like age, occupation, martial status have only a minor impact on coupon acceptance rate.


The second part of the exercise was to explore the dataset. I explored Carry out and Take Away coupon acceptance. 
Overall there is a 74% acceptance of this coupon which is pretty high.
Customers driving home had the highest acceptance rate and interestingly there was not a strong linear relationship between coupon acceptance and # of times the driver does Carry Out and Take Away
Sunny weather had a considerably higher acceptance rate compared to rainy and snowy weather

Highest acceptance rate for Carryout and Take away coupon is for the group is driving home on a sunny day and the restaurant is in the same direction that they are driving. The acceptance rate is 82.3%
The lowest acceptance rate is for the group that is driving to work on a rainy day even if the restaurant is in the same direction. The acceptance rate is 31%

Next Steps: As a next step it will be interesting to compare against other types of coupons and will also be interesting to look at predictive power of each of the variables to customize and optimize the coupons for each type of customer based on their demographics and driving attributes
